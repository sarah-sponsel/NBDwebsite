        <img src="images\oreo_balls.jpg" alt="Oreo Balls" width="350">
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>38 oreo cookies</li>
            <li>8 oz room temperature cream cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup chocolate melting wafers or candy coating</li>
            <li> cup white chocolate melting wafers or candy coating</li>
            <li>For Decorating: melted chocolate, oreo crumbs, sprinkles, crushed peppermint, or chopped nuts, if desired</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>Place Oreo cookies in a food processor. Pulse until they are fine cookie crumbs.</li>
            <li>Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, beat the cream cheese until it is smooth, about 1 minute. Add the Oreo cookie crumbs and mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Roll the Oreo mixture into small balls and place on a baking sheet or try that has been lined with parchment paper or wax paper. Freeze the Oreo balls for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the chocolate wafers (or candy coating) in a small microwave safe bowl. Place the white chocolate wafers (or candy coating) in a separate small microwave safe bowl. Melt according to the instructions on the packaging.</li>
            <li>Remove the balls from teh freezer and dip the balls into the melted chocolate. make sure you cover teh balls completely in chocolate. I like to use a fork to shake the excess chocolate off of the Oreo balls. Dip half of the balls in the chocoalte and half in the white chocolate. Place the dipped balls back on the backing tray with parchment paper or wax paper. Decorate with a drizzle of chocolate, additional crushed Oreos, sprinkles, crushed peppermint, or crushed nuts, if desired</li>
            <li>Place the baking sheet with the Oreo balls in the refrigerator and chill for at least an hour. Keep stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. The Oreo balls will keep in the fridge for up to 3 weeks. You can also freeze the balls for up to 2 months.</li>
